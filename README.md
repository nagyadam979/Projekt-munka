    Understand and analyze the data, then find patterns and correlations between variables. 

Steps:
Visualize multidimensional data, then reduce dimensions. 
Data transformation, manipulation and clusterisation. Fit linear regression model to the right data.
Result:
Find the dependency between the variables, and the possibilities of some really interesting hidden patterns

Used tools:
